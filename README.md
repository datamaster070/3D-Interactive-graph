# Inception V3 Visualization

Plots layer outputs of an Inception V3 network (using keras.js) in 3D using three.js

# Overview
This project visualizes the outputs of the layers of an Inception V3 neural network using Keras.js and Three.js. It provides an interactive 3D visualization interface where users can load images, run them through the Inception V3 model, and observe how the data transforms across various layers.

# Features
Load and preprocess images for inference
Visualize output data from each layer of the Inception V3 model in 3D space
Interactive controls to switch between layers and modify visualization settings
Easy setup and usage with Keras.js and Three.js
